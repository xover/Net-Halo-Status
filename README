Net-Halo-Status version 0.02
============================

Net::Halo::Status implements the Halo server status protcol; the same protocol
used when you click on a server in the network lobby in the Halo client. This
is a different protocol from the Halo client/server protocol, so, sadly, no
scripted rcon access or similar.

INSTALLATION

This module can be built using either ExtUtils::MakeMaker or Module::Build.

For those used to the old way of doing things, the following works:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

However, going forward focus will be on Module::Build, where the installation
procedure is:

  perl Build.PL
  ./Build
  ./Build test
  ./Build install


DEPENDENCIES

Net::Halo::Status requires Module::Build and IO::Socket::INET.
